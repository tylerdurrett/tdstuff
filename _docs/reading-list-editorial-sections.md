# Reading List: Editorial Sections

The reading list is organized into six editorial sections. Each section has a distinct voice and purpose. When sorting an article, work through the decision tree below — take the **first match**.

## Quick Sort: Decision Tree

Ask these questions in order. Stop at the first "yes."

1. **Is it about AI agents, coding agents, or human-AI workflows?** → **Agentic Systems**
2. **Is it exposing harm, abuse of power, or calling bullshit?** → **Damage Control**
3. **Is it a product launch, model release, or company announcement?** → **Products & Announcements**
4. **Is it a creative project, generative art, or visual/interactive experience?** → **Creative Code**
5. **Is it about the craft of writing software (tools, patterns, languages)?** → **Programming**
6. **Is it explaining how a technology works under the surface?** → **Under the Hood**

If it could go in two sections, the higher one on this list wins.

## The Sections

### Damage Control

**Identity:** The watchdog. Biting critique of power systems — corporate, governmental, institutional. Exposé pieces about the damage being done in the name of AI, money, and control.

**Put it here when the article:**
- Critiques corporate behavior, surveillance, or exploitation
- Covers labor impacts, job displacement, or worker exploitation
- Debunks AI hype or calls out misleading claims
- Addresses privacy violations or data harvesting
- Reports on government overreach or civil liberties erosion
- Covers AI safety failures or ethical violations
- Exposes economic inequality driven by technology

**Typical topics:** Corporate Accountability, AI Safety, AI Hype, AI Ethics, Labor Economics, Data Privacy, Government Surveillance, Civil Liberties, Attention Economy, AI & Inequality

**Not this section:** Industry analysis that isn't critical (→ Products & Announcements). Technical explanations of how models fail (→ Under the Hood). Economic trends that are purely descriptive (→ Products & Announcements).

---

### Agentic Systems

**Identity:** The frontier. Where AI agents meet real work — coding agents, orchestration, human-AI collaboration, the evolving practice of working alongside machines.

**Put it here when the article:**
- Covers AI coding assistants or agent-based development workflows
- Discusses human-AI collaboration patterns or practices
- Explains agent architectures, orchestration, or multi-agent systems
- Covers vibe coding or AI-assisted programming as a practice
- Addresses context management, tool use, or MCP
- Evaluates agent capabilities or compares agent approaches
- Discusses productivity impacts specifically tied to AI agent usage

**Typical topics:** AI Coding Agents, AI Agents, Human-AI Collaboration, Vibe Coding, Task Orchestration, LLM Context Management, Model Context Protocol, AI & Productivity, Prompt Engineering

**Not this section:** A product announcement about a new AI agent (→ Products & Announcements). A critique of how agents are being misused (→ Damage Control). How LLMs work internally (→ Under the Hood). General programming without an AI angle (→ Programming).

---

### Programming

**Identity:** The craft. For developers who care about building software well — tooling, architecture, open source, languages, the discipline of the work itself.

**Put it here when the article:**
- Covers developer tools, editors, CLI utilities, or dev environments
- Discusses software architecture, design patterns, or best practices
- Is about open source projects, communities, or licensing
- Covers specific languages, frameworks, or runtime environments
- Addresses DevOps, CI/CD, infrastructure, or deployment
- Discusses software craftsmanship, code quality, or engineering culture
- Is developer-to-developer nerd talk with no AI agent angle

**Typical topics:** Developer Tooling, Software Craftsmanship, Open Source, Software Architecture, DevOps, Frontend Development, JavaScript Ecosystem, Web Frameworks, Self-Hosting, Cloud Infrastructure

**Not this section:** Using AI to write code (→ Agentic Systems). A creative art project that uses code (→ Creative Code). A product launch for a dev tool (→ Products & Announcements).

---

### Products & Announcements

**Identity:** The wire. What shipped, what launched, what changed. Product news, model releases, corporate strategy moves, industry developments.

**Put it here when the article:**
- Announces a new product, feature, or service
- Covers a model release or major version update
- Reports on corporate strategy, acquisitions, or pivots
- Provides industry analysis or market commentary (non-critical)
- Covers funding rounds, partnerships, or business moves
- Is essentially news reporting about what happened in tech/AI

**Typical topics:** Corporate AI Strategy, AI Business Models, OpenAI, Semiconductor Industry, Enterprise AI Adoption, AI Infrastructure (when about products)

**Not this section:** If the "announcement" is really about the harm the product will cause (→ Damage Control). If the article is a deep technical analysis of the product's architecture (→ Under the Hood). If it's a hands-on developer guide for the product (→ Programming or Agentic Systems).

---

### Creative Code

**Identity:** The gallery. Where code becomes expression — generative art, data visualization, interactive experiences, creative applications of programming. It's not *about* programming; it's what you can *make* with it.

**Put it here when the article:**
- Showcases generative art, creative coding, or algorithmic art
- Covers data visualization as a craft or art form
- Features interactive web experiences or installations
- Discusses computer graphics, shaders, or 3D work in a creative context
- Covers game development with an aesthetic or experiential focus
- Is about creative tools and workflows for visual/audio expression
- Features music generation, web audio, or audiovisual projects

**Typical topics:** Creative Coding, Generative Art, Computer Graphics, Data Visualization, 3D Modeling, Shaders, Game Development, Web Animation, p5.js, Three.js, TouchDesigner, Gaussian Splatting

**Not this section:** UI design patterns for web apps (→ Programming). An AI image generator product launch (→ Products & Announcements). A critique of AI-generated art replacing human artists (→ Damage Control).

---

### Under the Hood

**Identity:** The lab. How things actually work. Research papers, benchmarks, architectural deep-dives, reasoning analysis. For people who want to understand the machinery, not just use it.

**Put it here when the article:**
- Explains how a model, algorithm, or system works internally
- Covers AI benchmarks, evaluations, or capability analysis
- Discusses LLM reasoning, training methods, or architecture
- Is a research paper summary or analysis
- Covers multimodal AI capabilities from a technical lens
- Addresses AI-generated content quality or detection from a technical angle
- Discusses fine-tuning, inference optimization, or model internals

**Typical topics:** AI Benchmarks, LLM Reasoning, AI Architecture, Multimodal AI, AI Training Data, Reinforcement Learning, Transformer Models, AI Infrastructure (when about how things work), Diffusion Models, AI Interpretability

**Not this section:** Using a model to build an agent workflow (→ Agentic Systems). Critiquing the ethics of training data (→ Damage Control). A new model announcement (→ Products & Announcements).
