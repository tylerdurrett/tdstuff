The user wants to set the status of a plan folder to "ready".

The way we do that is to move the parent folder from the `_tasks/_planning/` folder to the `_tasks/_ready-to-start/` folder.

For example, the user may provide you with either a feature description doc like `_tasks/_planning/2026-02-12_telegram-integration/2026-02-12_feature-description.md` or perhaps an implementation guide or perhaps the parent folder like `_tasks/_planning/2026-02-12_telegram-integration/` or perhaps even just a description of the feature/initiative. Move the entire feature folder from `_tasks/_planning/` to `_tasks/_ready-to-start/`.

When you're done, please commit the changes.
