The user wants to set the status of a plan folder to "abandoned".

The way we do that is to move the parent folder from the current folder (e.g. `_tasks/_in-progress/`) to the `_tasks/_abandoned/` folder.

For example, the user may provide you with either an implementation guide doc like `_tasks/_in-progress/2026-02-12_telegram-integration/2026-02-12_implementation-guide.md` or perhaps the parent folder like `_tasks/_in-progress/2026-02-12_telegram-integration/` or perhaps even just a description of the feature/initiative. Move the entire feature folder from its current location to `_tasks/_abandoned/`.

When you're done, please commit the changes.
