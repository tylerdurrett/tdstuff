The user wants to set the status of a plan folder to "icebox".

The way we do that is to move the parent folder from (e.g. `_tasks/_planning/`) folder to the `_tasks/_icebox/` folder.

For example, the user may provide you with either a feature description doc like `_tasks/_planning/2026-02-12_telegram-integration/2026-02-12_feature-description.md` or perhaps an implementation guide or perhaps the parent folder like `_tasks/_planning/2026-02-12_telegram-integration/` or perhaps even just a description of the feature/initiative. Move the entire dated folder of the feature-related docs from its current location (e.g. a subfolder of `_tasks/_planning/`) to `_tasks/_icebox/`.

When you're done, please commit the changes.
