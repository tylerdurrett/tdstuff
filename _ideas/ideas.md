### Weekly snapshots

- What were the biggest topics/themes of the week? (doesn't necessarily need to be my literal "topics" but could be more fluid/dynamic based on the specific articles).
- What was the overall sentiment of the week?
- If we could boil the week down to one sentence, what would it say?
- Do we also have monthly/quarterly/yearly versions? How would those differ if at all?

### Some kind of sentiment per article, in numeric format

- Maybe we have a few dimensions:
  - optimistic vs pessimistic
  - generic postive vs negative? Or maybe that's derived
  - Excited vs disinterested (meh)
  - IDK, optimistic vs pessimistic seems to capture it

Then we can use that to show a chart of sentiment over time, and wrap that into the weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly snapshots.

### Product releases per day/week?

We may be able to just do this from the data as is, and show it on a chart.
We may also want a specific "model releases" topic or category for tracking that separately

### Featured hotness layouts

- Update homepage layout to feel like a really great dashboard/snapshot of what's happening today and yesterday
- Same for topic and category sub pages

### Category Branding

- Update major category sections to have their own feel and layouts

### Procedural remotion addition

- Somewhere somehow auto-generate a collection of remotion procedural backgrounds based on content
- Incorporate into layouts

### Article "last updated" and re-checking of conversations

- include a "hotness" metric that represents CURRENT hotness
- include a controversial metric for things that are deeply dividing
- include an overall "talk of the town" type of measure for total amount of conversation regardless of current
- Refetch discussions 1 or 2 days later (or both if it's a hot converstation) to make sure we capture the full conversation
